The Iris Theatre strives to offer family friendly entertainment that is suitable for all ages. Our team of volunteers do their best to preview the movies that we show; however there may be occasions where language or content slips past our screening process. The Iris Theatre does not condone vulgar language or objectionable content and will remain diligent in our efforts to provide wholesome family entertainment.
