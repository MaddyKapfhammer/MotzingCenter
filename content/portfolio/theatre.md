### Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank

A down-on-his luck hound finds himself in a town full of cats who need a hero to defend them from a ruthless villain's evil plot to wip their village of the map. With help from a reluctant trainer, the underdog must assume the role of fearsome samurai and team up with the felines to save the day. The only problem is -- they all hate dogs.
