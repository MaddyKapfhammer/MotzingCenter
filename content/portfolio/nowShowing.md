## Ron's Gone Wrong

[![Ron's Gone Wrong](https://img.youtube.com/vi/818nMtzN05s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I8nMtzN05s)

### Barney is a socially awkward schoolboy who receives a robot named Ron -- a walking, talking, digitally connected device that's supposed to be his best friend. Barney is excited to finally have his own robot -- until his new toy starts to hilariously malfunction, drawing the attention of a shady executive who wants to protect his company's stock price at all costs.
