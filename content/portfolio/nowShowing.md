## In the Heights

### In Washington Heights, N.Y., the scent of warm coffee hangs in the air just outside of the 181st St. subway stop, where a kaleidoscope of dreams rallies a vibrant and tight-knit community. At the intersection of it all is a likeable and magnetic bodega owner who hopes, images and sings about a better life.
